# PriorityQueueInCPP
This is an implementation of priority queue in CPP using OOPS concepts.

Structure of the input:

struct InPut {
	int priority;
	string value;
};

Output:

4, Access is granted.
4, Access is denied.
3, Access is granted.
2, Access is granted.

Edge case:

Same priority 

How the edge case was handled:

Based on the value  - Accept or Decline
precedence is given to values of Accept.

How to use the code:

Clone the directory
Compile for g++ 
Compile: g++ -Wall -c "%f"
Link: g++ -Wall -o "%e" "%f"
Execute: "./%e"
Refer the attached screenshot.
